The formal resignation of his title as “Head of the Macintosh Division” was submitted on **September 17, 1985**, and by the end of that month he had left the company for good.\n",

      "|------|-------|--------------|\n",
      "| **1976** | Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne co‑found Apple Computer, Inc. | Jobs becomes the charismatic, product‑obsessed visionary; Wozniak supplies the engineering brilliance. |\n",
      "| **1977** | Apple II released | First major commercial success; Apple goes public in 1980. |\n",
      "| **1983** | John Sculley, former PepsiCo marketing chief, is recruited as Apple’s CEO. | Jobs, who had previously convinced Sculley to join Pepsi, now works under him. The relationship is initially collaborative but soon becomes strained. |\n",
      "| **1984** | Macintosh launched (January) | Jobs spearheads the project, but the product’s high price and limited software ecosystem cause disappointing sales. |\n",

      "### 2.1 Divergent Visions\n",
      "- **Jobs**: Believed Apple should focus on groundbreaking, design‑first products (Macintosh) even at the cost of short‑term profits.\n",
      "- **Sculley**: Pressured by the board to improve margins, increase market share, and keep the Apple II line profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 The “Power Struggle”\n",
      "- By mid‑1985, the Macintosh division (run by Jobs) and the Apple II division (run by senior executives loyal to Sculley) were essentially two competing businesses inside the same company.\n",
      "- The board grew uneasy about Jobs’ increasingly autocratic management style and his public criticism of Sculley.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.3 The Board Meeting\n",
      "- **Date:** Early September 1985 (exact date varies by source, but the decisive meeting is recorded as **September 16‑17, 1985**).\n",
      "- **Outcome:** The board voted to **strip Jobs of his operational authority** over the Macintosh division and to place the division under Sculley’s direct control.\n",
      "- **Jobs’ Reaction:** He attempted to rally support from the Macintosh engineering team but found that many senior managers had already aligned with Sculley.\n",

      "\n",
      "> **Note:** While the term “fired” is commonly used in popular accounts, the technical process was a board‑mandated removal of authority followed by Jobs’ own resignation.

      "### 4.3 The Return\n",
      "- **1996:** Apple acquires NeXT for **$429 million**. The acquisition brings Jobs back as an advisor.\n",

      "2. **Corporate Governance** – The board’s decision underscores the importance of clear succession planning and the risks of having two competing product lines under separate leadership.\n",
      "3. **Cultural Impact** – Jobs’ departure forced Apple to confront a lack of design‑driven culture, a void that he later restored after his return.\n",
      "4. **Technological Legacy** – NeXT’s software, developed during Jobs’ exile, became the core of Apple’s modern operating systems (macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS).\n",

      "| Question | Answer |\n",
      "|----------|--------|\n",
      "| **Did Apple ever officially announce “Steve Jobs was fired”?** | No. Apple’s public communications framed the event as a “restructuring” and a “board‑mandated change in leadership.” The phrase “fired” is a media shorthand. |\n",
      "| **Was there any legal settlement?** | No lawsuit was filed. Jobs left voluntarily after the board’s decision, and Apple and Jobs later negotiated a settlement regarding his stock options when he returned in 1997. |\n",
      "| **How did the market react at the time?** | The immediate market reaction was muted; Apple’s stock was already under pressure from declining Apple II sales. The real impact was felt later as the company’s product line lost direction. |\n",
      "| **What can modern CEOs learn from this?** | Balance visionary ambition with operational pragmatism, maintain clear communication with the board, and avoid internal power silos that can lead to destructive infighting. |\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "Steve Jobs’ departure from Apple was formalized in **mid‑September 1985**, when the board stripped him of his operational authority and he subsequently resigned. The episode set the stage for both Apple’s near‑collapse in the early 1990s and its spectacular resurgence after Jobs’ return—a reminder that even the most iconic founders can be ousted, only to later reshape the very company that once let them go.\n"

The film covers fourteen years in the life of Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, specifically ahead of three press conferences he gave during that time: the formal unveiling of the Macintosh 128K on January 24, 1984; the unveiling of the NeXT Computer on October 12, 1988; and')]\n"

      "  LangChain ships with a variety of built‑in memory classes that you can plug directly into a chain or agent. The most commonly used ones are:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Memory class | What it does | Typical use‑case |\n",
      "|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n",
      "| **ConversationBufferMemory** | Stores the full chat history as a plain text buffer. | Simple bots that need the entire conversation context. |\n",
      "| **ConversationBufferWindowMemory** (or **BufferWindowMemory**) | Keeps only the last *k* turns. | Keeps context lightweight while still remembering recent dialogue. |\n",
      "| **ConversationSummaryMemory** | Summarizes the whole conversation into a short text that is passed forward. | Long‑running chats where token cost would explode if you kept everything. |\n",
      "| **ConversationSummaryBufferMemory** | Combination of a buffer and a periodic summary (keeps recent turns plus a running summary). | Mid‑size conversations where you want both recent detail and overall gist. |\n",
      "| **EntityMemory** | Extracts named entities (people, places, objects, etc.) from the dialogue and stores facts about them. | Scenarios that need a “knowledge base” of people, products, dates, etc. |\n",
      "| **ConversationKnowledgeGraphMemory** | Builds a graph of entities and their relationships from the chat history. | When you need to reason about how different pieces of information connect. |\n",
      "| **VectorStoreRetrieverMemory** | Persists chunks of conversation (or external docs) in a vector store and retrieves the most relevant pieces via semantic search. | Retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) or long‑term memory across sessions. |\n",
      "| **BufferMemory** (generic) | Low‑level buffer that can store raw `BaseMessage` objects or strings. | When you want full control over how messages are formatted. |\n",
      "| **CombinedMemory** | Composes two or more memory objects (e.g., a buffer + a summary) into a single interface. | Complex pipelines that need multiple memory strategies simultaneously. |\n",
      "| **ConversationTokenBufferMemory** | Similar to `ConversationBufferMemory` but stops adding turns once a token limit is reached. | Token‑budget‑aware bots. |\n",
      "| **InMemoryStore / Long‑term memory stores** (via LangGraph) | Simple key‑value or vector‑store backed store that can be persisted across runs. | Persistent user‑specific data, preferences, or long‑term facts. |\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to pick one\n",
      "- **Need full history?** → `ConversationBufferMemory` (or `BufferMemory` if you want raw messages).  \n",
      "- **Want only recent turns?** → `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` / `BufferWindowMemory`.  \n",
      "- **Running out of tokens on long chats?** → `ConversationSummaryMemory` or `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory`.  \n",
      "- **Need factual recall about entities?** → `EntityMemory` or `ConversationKnowledgeGraphMemory`.  \n",
      "- **Want semantic retrieval from a large corpus?** → `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory` (backed by Pinecone, FAISS, etc.).  \n",
      "- **Combine strategies?** → `CombinedMemory`.\n",
      "\n",
      "These classes all inherit from `BaseChatMemory` (or `BaseMemory`) and expose the same interface (`load_memory_variables`, `save_context`, etc.), so you can swap them in and out of a `ConversationChain`, `LLMChain`, or any LangChain agent with minimal code changes.\n"
