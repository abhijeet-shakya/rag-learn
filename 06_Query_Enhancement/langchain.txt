LangChain is a popular framework used to build applications powered by large language models. It provides abstractions for prompts, chains, tools, memory, retrievers, and agents. Developers often use LangChain to construct Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines where user queries are enhanced, rewritten, or expanded before retrieval. Query enhancement helps models better understand user intent and retrieve more relevant context from document stores. Query enhancement techniques include query rewriting, query expansion, and intent clarification. In LangChain-based systems, a user’s raw question may be ambiguous or incomplete. An LLM can rewrite the query into a clearer, more explicit form. For example, a short query like “embeddings” may be expanded into “What are text embeddings and how are they used in dense retrieval pipelines within LangChain?” This enhanced query improves retrieval quality. CrewAI is a framework designed for building multi-agent systems where each agent has a specific role and responsibility. Instead of a single agent handling everything, CrewAI allows teams of agents to collaborate on tasks such as research, planning, execution, and validation. Query enhancement fits naturally into CrewAI workflows, where one agent may specialize in refining or expanding queries before another agent performs retrieval or reasoning. In a CrewAI setup, a query enhancement agent may analyze the user input, identify missing context, and generate multiple candidate queries. Another agent may evaluate which enhanced query is most effective. This multi-agent collaboration leads to better retrieval coverage and more accurate downstream results. LangChain agents and CrewAI agents both rely on tools. These tools may include retrievers, vector databases, web search, calculators, or custom APIs. Enhanced queries help these tools perform more effectively. When queries are clearer and more specific, sparse retrievers like BM25 and dense retrievers using embeddings both return higher-quality results. Dense retrieval benefits greatly from query enhancement. When embeddings are generated from enriched queries, they capture more semantic detail. This leads to better alignment between queries and document chunks. Sparse retrieval also benefits, as enhanced queries introduce relevant keywords that improve lexical matching. Hybrid retrieval systems combine sparse and dense methods. Query enhancement improves both components simultaneously. LangChain supports hybrid retrievers, making it easy to test how enhanced queries affect recall and precision. CrewAI pipelines can orchestrate multiple retrieval attempts using different enhanced queries and then merge results. Another important query enhancement technique is query decomposition. Complex questions can be broken into smaller, focused sub-queries. For example, a question about LangChain and CrewAI integration may be decomposed into sub-questions about LangChain agents, CrewAI roles, and communication patterns. Each sub-query retrieves targeted information. CrewAI excels at task decomposition. One agent can decompose a complex query, another can enhance each sub-query, and another can aggregate retrieved results. This structured approach improves reasoning quality and transparency. Prompt engineering plays a role in query enhancement. Well-crafted prompts guide models to generate better rewritten queries. LangChain provides prompt templates that standardize how query enhancement prompts are written and reused. Evaluation is crucial when practicing query enhancement. Developers can compare retrieval results from raw queries versus enhanced queries. Metrics such as recall, precision, and diversity help quantify improvements. Manual inspection also reveals how enhanced queries change retrieved context. Query enhancement is especially useful in enterprise search, research assistants, and multi-agent reasoning systems. LangChain provides the building blocks, while CrewAI provides orchestration and collaboration. Together, they enable advanced AI systems that understand user intent more deeply. As systems scale, automated query enhancement becomes increasingly valuable. CrewAI agents can continuously refine queries based on feedback and past performance. LangChain pipelines can log enhanced queries for analysis and iteration. Practicing with datasets that include overlapping concepts, similar terminology, and varying levels of detail is ideal for learning query enhancement. Documents should discuss LangChain, CrewAI, agents, tools, embeddings, retrieval, and multi-agent coordination from different perspectives. By experimenting with query rewriting, expansion, decomposition, and ranking, practitioners gain intuition about how queries influence retrieval and generation.
